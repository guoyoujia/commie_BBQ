# "Commie" BBQ

This is a standardized recipe my dad adapted from former Soviet Union.

## Ingredients

I always use lamb with this recipe but mutton and goat are presumably good as well.

- 3 pound of lamb shoulder or hind shank.
- 3 big red onions.

## Marinade

The basal marinade can be premade by mixing all the liquids with sugar and stored in fridge. Fennel seed needs to be added right before marination. One big red onion and 1/3 cup of premade marinade are needed per pound of meat.

- 1 cup of huangjiu (Chinese: 黄酒; 'yellow wine').
- 1 cup of laochou (Chinese: 老抽; 'dark soy sause').
- 1 cup of shengchou (Chinese: 生抽; 'light soy sause').
- 16 tea spoon of sugar.
- 8 ounces of fennel seed.

**Example 1 pound of meat**

- 1 pound meat.
- 1 big red onion.
- 1/3 cup of basal marinade.
- 1 ounce of fennel seed.

**Example 3 pounds of meat**

- 3 pound meat.
- 3 big red onion.
- 1 cup of basal marinade.
- 3 ounce of fennel seed.

## Steps

1. Cut meat into ~2 inches cubes.
2. Cut onion into slices.
3. Mix meat, onion, basal marinade, and fennel seed thoroughly in a big bowl.
4. Marinate overnight in refrigeration. Use flat container (e.g. zip bag / baking pan etc) for best marination.
5. Grill or broil with high temperature setting.
